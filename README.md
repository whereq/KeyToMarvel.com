# [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)
**Keycloak** is an open-source software solution that enables **Single Sign-On (SSO)** with **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**, designed for modern applications and services. Since March 2018, this JBoss community project has been overseen by **Red Hat** and serves as the upstream project for their **RH-SSO** product.

**Keycloak** simplifies the process of adding authentication to applications and securing services, eliminating the need to manage user storage or handle authentication directly. It offers features like user federation, strong authentication,  **user management**, fine-grained authorization, and more, with minimal integration effort.

# [WhereQ - Keycloak](https://github.com/whereq/KeyToMarvel.com)
**WhereQ - Keycloak** aims to stay up-to-date with the latest Keycloak releases, while offering integration with additional **Social Identity Providers** not included in the default Keycloak distribution, such as **Apple** and **WeChat**. Additionally, WhereQ is developing support for **multi-tenancy** and providing **customizable themes** tailored to specific client needs, ensuring flexibility and scalability for a wide range of identity management requirements.
